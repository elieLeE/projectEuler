/* 1 / x + 1 / y = 1 / n means that y = x * y / (x - n).
 * n is fixed and x has to be greater than n (as x, y and n are positives).
 * To avoid duplicated solutions, x has to be below than 2 * n.
 * Moreover, it looks logical that n has to be even to maximize the solutions.
 * As this was still not sufficient to have a "fast" solution, I have printed
 * the number when maximal and saw that they were all on the form 10^n.
 * So I have restrained calculation on all 10^n.
 * Got result in 6s.
 *
 * Can certainly do better. To see how.
